# Features

This category contains all the user-facing features of the application. Each feature is typically organized into its own sub-directory.

A feature usually consists of:
- **UI Layer**: The widgets that form the user interface (e.g., `HomePage`, `AboutPage`).
- **State Management**: The logic that manages the state of the UI (e.g., `HomeCubit`, `HomeState`).
