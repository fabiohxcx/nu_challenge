# App

This category includes the core setup and foundational components of the application.

Classes in this category are responsible for:
- Initializing the application (`MyApp`).
- Configuring top-level dependency injection (e.g., `MultiRepositoryProvider`).
- Defining navigation routes (`AppRouter`, `AppRoutes`).
- Setting up the global theme and `MaterialApp`.
